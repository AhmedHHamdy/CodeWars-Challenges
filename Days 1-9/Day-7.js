/*
--> Decibel Scale
he following formula is called the Decibel Scale:

Decibel Scale Formula

The Decibel Scale is used to determine the loudness of a sound, measured in dB:

Î² is the result we want, defined in dB;
We multiply the result of the logarithmic operation by 10, otherwise it'll be called "Bel Scale";
We provide I, the intensity of the sound wave we need to find the loudness of, which is, for the purposes of this Kata, 
measured in 2D space and, hence, in Watts per square meter;
Finally, we divide the intensity by the threshold of human hearing, also measured in Watts per square meter.
This is the softest possible sound a human ear can hear;
Since the threshold of human hearing involves an extremely small, long number,
we need to utilize a logarithmic operation that will provide us the result in a convenient way.
Your task is to simply calculate the loudness of a sound wave,
given its intensity as a parameter to the dBScale/db_scale function.

/*
--> Find the first non-consecutive number
Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not,
so that's the first non-consecutive number.

If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers.
The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!

If you like this Kata, maybe try this one next: https://www.codewars.com/kata/represent-array-of-numbers-as-ranges

1 Can you write a solution that will return null2 for both [] and [ x ] though? 
(This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )

/*
--> Pirates!! Are the Cannons ready!??
Ahoy Matey!

Welcome to the seven seas.

You are the captain of a pirate ship.

You are in battle against the royal navy.

You have cannons at the ready.... or are they?

Your task is to check if the gunners are loaded and ready, if they are: Fire!

If they aren't ready: Shiver me timbers!

Your gunners for each test case are 2, 3 or 4.

When you check if they are ready their answers are in a dictionary and will either be: aye or nay

Firing with less than all gunners ready is non-optimum (this is not fire at will, 
this is fire by the captain's orders or walk the plank, dirty sea-dog!)

If all answers are 'aye' then Fire! if one or more are 'nay' then Shiver me timbers!

bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);
